# Download Dataset
Sine the dataset is huge. I'm not uploading it here. Here's how to set it up:
1. Go to the [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ix8u21atdwrstmgjkz2rx/AP5fheclFPjfbBMbeHoqPow?rlkey=kcbecly7tetqu57v4tsmo095m&e=2&dl=0)
2. Download the `track_1` directory
3. Put it in `./data/nico_pp/`
4. Unzip the `track_1` directory within the `./data/nico_pp/track_1/` directory you just downloaded
5. Ultimately your images will be in subdirectories in `./data/nico_pp/track_1/track_1/` and your ID mapping will be in `./data/nico_pp/track_1/` where `./` is your project root directory
