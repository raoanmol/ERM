# Download Dataset
Since the dataset is huge. I'm not uploading it here. Here's how to set it up:
1. Go to the [BAR GitHub Repository](https://github.com/alinlab/BAR)
2. Click the drop down on the green **Code** button
3. Click 'Download ZIP'
4. Unzip the file
5. Copy the `./test/` and `./train/` directories into this project's `./data/bar/` directory
6. Ultimately your images should be in `./data/bar/train/` and `./data/bar/test/` where `./` is your project root directory
